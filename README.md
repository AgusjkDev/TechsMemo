# TechsMemo 🧠

[**TechsMemo**](https://techsmemo.vercel.app) is a basic memory game made from scratch with Astro — _and Svelte_ — and TailwindCSS. The objective of the game is to flip all the technologies in the least possible number of flips🔁 and time⏳

The game provides a pool of **+75 possible technologies**👨‍💻 and a _very comfortable playground_ with a *simple UI/UX design*💻
